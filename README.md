# Traffic Lights

## 6Description
The traffic light system model mimics a real T-intersection. The  components implemented include a servo motor acting as a gate, a traffic light system with pedestrian cross light, and streetlights. The gate uses IR sensors to detect motion, the cross light is triggered by a button that changes the timing of the traffic lights and the streetlights turn on and off using and LDR to check the brightness of the surrounding environment.

## Features
* Motion sensor gate
* Light dependent streetlights
* Pedestrian crosswalk button
