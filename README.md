#Traffic Lights

##Description
The traffic light system model mimics a real T-intersection. The  components implemented include a servo motor acting as a gate which was controlled with IR sensors, a traffic light system with pedestrian cross lights which is triggered by a button that changes timing of traffic lights, and streetlights that turn on and off using an LDR depending on how bright the surrounding environment is.

##Features
* Motion sensor gate
* Light dependent streetlights
* Pedestrian crosswalk button
